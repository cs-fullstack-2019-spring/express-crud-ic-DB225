### Note: Ignore everything about pokemon. I decided last minute to use regular User data instead.

Do not create a new project. Create the following endpoints:
- Find by ID
- Find by Name
- Find by Username
- Update Name, Username, and Email
- Update Company
- Delete by Id

Style a Pug view so the user know their request when through or there was an error.
